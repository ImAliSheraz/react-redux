# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# React-Redux Essential Concepts

These are Reduxâ€™s main pillars:

## Store

A store is an object that holds the application's state tree. There should only be a single store in a Redux app, as the composition happens at the reducer level.

### dispatch()

dispatch() dispatches an action. It is the only way to update the application state.

## Action

An action is a plain object that represents an intention to change the state. They must have a property to indicate the type of action to be carried out.

Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store.

Any data, whether from UI events or network callbacks, needs to eventually be dispatched as actions.

Actions must have a type field, indicating the type of action being performed.

## Reducers

Reducers are pure functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

Actions only describe what happened, not how the application's state changes.

A reducer is a function that accepts the current state and action, and returns a new state with the action performed.

combineReducers() utility can be used to combine all the reducers in the app into a single index reducer which makes maintainability much easier.
